When a product is added to the cart, a sidebar will appear from the right side of the page. The sidebar will display a list of items in the cart, with an image, name, and quantity for each item. Users can click the plus and minus buttons next to each item to adjust the quantity. The sidebar also shows the total cost of the items in the cart.

To close the cart sidebar, users can click the "X" button in the top right corner of the sidebar.

## Styles

The web page uses CSS to style the different elements of the page. The styles are divided into global styles, header styles, container styles, and cart styles.

The global styles apply to all elements on the page, setting the box-sizing, background color, margin, and font family.

The header styles apply specifically to the header element, setting the background color, text color, and alignment of its contents.

The container styles apply to the grid of product cards, setting the display, flex-wrap, gap, and padding.

The cart styles apply to the sidebar that appears when a user adds a product to their cart. It sets the position, size, and background color of the sidebar, as well as the styles for the list of items and buttons to adjust the quantity.
